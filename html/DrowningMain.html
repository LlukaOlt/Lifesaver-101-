            <h3>Signs of Drowning</h3>
            <p><strong></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silent:</strong> There’s no spare breath to call for help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bobbing up and down:</strong> Their mouth could dip below the water’s surface, pop up just enough to breathe, and sink back down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stiff-armed:</strong> Instead of waving for help, someone who's drowning may have their arms out to the side. Their hands may be pressed down on the water to keep afloat. They most likely can't reach out to grab a life preserver.</li>
                    <li><strong>Still:</strong> Their body could be straight up and down, almost like they're standing in the water. You won't see kicking or flailing</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Call the authorities if:</h2>
                <p> Someone is drowning.
                    A child is having problems breathing or has stopped breathing as a result of being underwater. (Remember, children can drown in as little as 1 inch of water.)
                    A child has had a near-drowning episode.</p>

                                        <li>Do chest compressions at the rate of 100-120 beats per minute(2 pushes per second). Let their chest spring back fully between each push.</li>

                                        <li>Breathe into their mouth for 1 second. Watch to see if their chest rises.
                                        <li> If their chest rises, give a second breath. If it doesn't, tilt their head back and lift their chin again.</li> 
                                        <li>Then, repeat your breath. Take care not to breathe with too much force.</li>
                                        <li>Give 30 more chest compressions, followed by 2 more rescue breaths. 
                                        <li>Follow this pattern until the person </li>begins to move or help arrives.
