<ol>
    <li><strong>Supervision</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constant and Active Monitoring</strong>: Always supervise children and non-swimmers when they are near or in water. Never rely solely on lifeguards or flotation devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Designate a Water Watcher</strong>: A responsible adult should be appointed to continuously monitor swimmers without distractions.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Barriers and Safety Equipment</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Install Barriers Around Pools</strong>: Use fences at least 4 feet high with self-closing, self-latching gates to prevent unsupervised access.</li>
            <li><strong>Pool Covers and Alarms</strong>: Use rigid covers and install pool alarms to alert you to unauthorized pool access.</li>
            <li><strong>Drain Covers</strong>: Ensure pool drains have proper safety covers to prevent entrapment.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Swimming Skills and Water Safety Education</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn to Swim</strong>: Enroll both children and adults in swim lessons to improve water competency.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Water Conditions</strong>: Teach swimmers how to recognize dangerous conditions such as rip currents and undertows.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Safety Courses</strong>: Participate in classes that cover lifesaving techniques and safe behavior around water.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Use of Life Jackets</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wear Approved Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs)</strong>: Ensure children and weak swimmers use U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets while boatin
                </li>
        </ul>   
                <p>Knowing how to swim is important. But even good swimmers can drown, and it can happen fast. <strong>Never</strong> take your eye off a child in the water. You have to watch them all the time. And not just in large bodies of water. Young children can drown in hot tubs, bathtubs, decorative ponds, buckets, and even toilets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Do not put yourself at risk to save the person from drowning, or you risk drowning yourself.</strong></p>
