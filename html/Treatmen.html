            <p>Nasal steroid sprays are generally the most effective medication for people with allergic rhinitis symptoms. Antihistamines block some of the effects of histamine and may offer additional benefits. Immunotherapy helps create a tolerance to allergens and can improve many of the symptoms related to inhalant allergy exposure.

                Remember, your body is unique. What over-the-counter or prescription medications work for one person may not work well for you.
                
                Talk to a healthcare provider. They can help recommend the best treatment for you.
